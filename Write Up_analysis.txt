--------------ETL Part-----------

1.Firstly i imported super store file into power bi desktop.

2.By using ETL tool transfered into power Query.

3.I applied star Schema to data set and devided into 4 dimensions DIM_OorderDetailes,DIM_Customers,DIM_products,DIM_date and 1 central fact table like Orders.

4.By using power Model build a One to Many relationship between Dimensions and Order table.

5.Order table ship mode column in place of 'FC' Row replaced with 'First Class'.

6.One new Calculated Column  'Sales' Created--sales=[Quantity]*(1-[Discount])*[As Per Each]--

7.One more new calculated Column 'Total Sales' created--Total Sales=[sales]*(1-[Discount])*Quantity---

8.Created one new Conditional Column 'Cart Value' based on 'sales' Column
	--Cart Value= IF Sales is <1000:	Low
			  Else IF sales is<3000:	Medium
			  Else IF sales is<10000:	High
			  Else IF sales is>10000:	Very High--

9.Extracted No Of 'Days to Delivery' by subtracting between 'Ship Date' and 'Order Date'.

10.From Orders table Ship mode,Address,Region Extracted as DIM_OrderDetails table.

11. DIM_Orderdetails table Address column Split into as City,State,Country,Pincode Columns and removed all Duplicate rows.

12.From Orders table Customer ID,Customer Name,Segment Extracted as DIM_Customers table and removed all Duplicate rows.

13.From Orders table Product ID,category,Sub Category,Product name Extracted as DIM_Products table and removed all Empty and Duplicate rows.

---------Visualization Part-------------

15.By Using card visual created 'Sum Of Sales' and 'Sum Of Total sales' Visuals.

16.By Using Donut Chart visual created 'Total Sales By Low cart value Category' visual by using filter on visual --by applying 'cart value' as Low.

17.By Using card visual created 'Total Sales By Low cart value and Discount >=50%' visual by using filter on visual --by applying 'cart value' as Low and Discount as >=50%.

18. Created Column Chart as 'Avg No Of Days To Deliver by Ship mode' visual  By using 'Ship Mode' and 'No Of Days To Deliver' Columns ( Value is 4).

19.Created Matrix table as 'Sales and Sales By Year to date' Visual By using 'Order Date' Hirarchy,'Sum of Sales' and 'YTD_Sales'(Created new measer---YTD_Sales = TotalYTD(sum(Order(sales)),Dim_date[Order date].[Date])--- Columns.

20.Created Matrix table as as 'Cumulative Of Sales By Each Month for all years and Year on Year growth' Visual By using 'Order Date' Hirarchy and 'Sum of Quantity','Cum_SalesMTD','YOY_Sales' Columns (Created new measure---YOY_sales = calculate(sum(order[sales]),DATEADD(DIM_date[rder date],-1,YEAR)---.
